## 5. Optimized OCR Workflow
The new 5-stage OCR workflow includes:
- **Stage 1**: Image Acquisition
- **Stage 2**: Preprocessing with per-app color profiles
- **Stage 3**: Text Recognition with foreground app detection
- **Stage 4**: Post-Processing using perceptual hashing for change detection
- **Stage 5**: Output Generation

This optimized pipeline enhances efficiency and accuracy.

## 6. Performance Optimization
The performance of the OCR system has been optimized through several strategies:
- **Adaptive Processing**: Tailors processing based on the foreground app.
- **Caching Mechanisms**: Reduces repeated calculations for the same images.

## 7. Per-App Color Profiles
The per-app color profile system allows for customized processing based on the application's color scheme, improving text recognition accuracy.

## 8. Interactive Color Picker
An interactive color picker will be integrated to allow users to select and adjust color profiles for their specific needs.

## 9. Performance Strategy
We will implement performance monitoring to continually assess and optimize the OCR processing times.
